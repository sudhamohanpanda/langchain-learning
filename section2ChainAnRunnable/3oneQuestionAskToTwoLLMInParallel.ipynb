      "\n",
      "1. Compact city form: This principle advocates for densely populated cities with a mix of land uses (residential, commercial, and recreational) within walking distance, reducing the need for cars and thus lowering greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Mixed-use development: This involves combining residential, commercial, and cultural activities in the same areas, creating vibrant neighborhoods that encourage walking and public transportation use.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Public transport-oriented design: This principle emphasizes the importance of investing in efficient and affordable public transportation systems to reduce car usage and greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Green infrastructure: This includes parks, green roofs, and urban forests, which help absorb carbon dioxide, reduce stormwater runoff, and provide habitats for wildlife.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Energy efficiency: Sustainable urban planning promotes energy-efficient buildings and renewable energy sources to lower cities' overall carbon footprint.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Climate resilience: This principle focuses on creating cities that can adapt to and recover from extreme weather events, such as floods and heatwaves, which are becoming more common due to climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Equity and social sustainability: Sustainable urban planning aims to create inclusive cities where all residents have access to quality housing, education, healthcare, and public spaces. This principle recognizes that addressing climate change requires taking into account the needs of vulnerable populations who are often disproportionately affected by its impacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "By incorporating these principles, sustainable urban planning can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air and water quality, promote healthier lifestyles, and create more resilient communities in the face of a changing climate.\n"
